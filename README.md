# SignLanguageRecognition

Video processing using MediaPipe for different approaches.
Includes also RNN model lab.

## 1. Detections to CSV

For extracting multi hand and face detections and saving them to a CSV file, we implemented the `DetectionsToCSVCalculator`.

## 2. Building RNN Model

The CSV files are used to train a deep learning model.
Therefore we use jupyter notebooks to simply write and comment a script.
Check out the folder `lab`.

## 3. Live prediction

The trained model is used for predicting live video stream.
